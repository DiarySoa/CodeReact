composer require chriskacerguis/codeigniter-restserver

Step 2: Copy Configuration File
After installing the library, you need to copy the rest.php configuration file to your CodeIgniter's application/config directory. This file contains settings for the REST server, such as base URLs and CORS settings.

Copy the rest.php file from the vendor/chriskacerguis/codeigniter-restserver/config directory to application/config/rest.php in your CodeIgniter project.


Step 3: Use the REST_Controller in Your Controllers
Now, you can start using the REST_Controller in your controllers. At the top of your controller file, add the following line to import the REST_Controller class:

use chriskacerguis\RestServer\RestController;

Then, extend your controller class from RestController instead of CI_Controller:

class MyRestController extends RestController {
    // Your controller methods here
}
Step 4: Define Routes
In your routes.php file, define routes that map to your RESTful controllers. For example:

$route['api/users'] = 'myrestcontroller/users';
Additional Notes
Ensure that your CodeIgniter project is configured to autoload Composer's autoloader. This is usually done by adding the following line to your index.php file:
require_once BASEPATH . '../vendor/autoload.php';
The REST_Controller library provides a range of features for building RESTful APIs, including automatic routing, input filtering, and output formatting. Refer to the official documentation for more details and examples.
By following these steps, you can easily integrate the REST_Controller library into your CodeIgniter project to build robust RESTful APIs.
